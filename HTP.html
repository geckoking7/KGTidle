		<h1 style='margin-top: 20px;'>Welcome to the Guide of the Gaming feature</h1>

		<h2>The more days you play, the harder it becomes :D</h2>
		<h4>The game is essentially a bunch of minigames, chosen from random, to play...</h4>
		<h3>...with modifiers :D</h3>
		<h3>______________________________________________</h3>
		<h2>Controls</h2>
		<h4>AWSD - Move</h4>
		<h4>Arrow keys - Shoot</h4>
		<h4>E - interact</h4>
		<h2>Rewards / purpose of existing</h2>
		<h4>The better you do, the more rewards you collect (XP, gold (basically xp), and some other goofy things)</h4>
		<h4>The xp reward is scaled in some boring quardratic line (was interesting but now bad)</h4>
		<h2>Gameplay</h2>
		<h4>All days will have a little shadow on the far right, that follows you and instantly kills you if you touch him, however, it is very slow</h4>
		<h4>Each day he becomes faster and faster, making him more of a threat</h4>
		<h4>There are also zones that all have different features and things to kill you with there own respective objectives</h4>
		<h5>That line was meant to get your hopes up, the time till a second zone is made will be in forever</h5>
		<h2 style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Outside</h2>
		<h5 style='font-style: italic; margin-top: 0; font-weight: light;'>Grass</h5>
		<h4>Outside is the first zone, having cars that can run over you, and thats it</h4>
		<h2>Objectives</h2>
		<h3>Catch the desert eagle</h3>
		<h4>Shoot down the desert eagle with the desert eagle</h4>
		<h3>Find and kill the imposter</h3>
		<h4>Walk around the people, and if an E shows, that means they're the imposter</h4>
		<h4>The imposter will kill someone, at random, every few seconds</h4>
		<h4>But, if all innocents die and the imposter is not found, you will be the next kill</h4>
		<h4>If you do find the imposter, kill him, and if you can't, just jump infront of a car</h4>
		<h2>Modifiers</h2>
		<h3>The war of emus</h3>
		<h4>Lots of emus run from the left and kill things (people only)</h4>
